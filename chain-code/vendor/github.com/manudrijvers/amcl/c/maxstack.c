	How to determine maximum stack usage
	1. Compile this file *with no optimization*, for example gcc -c maxstack.c
	2. Rename your main() function to mymain()
	3. Compile with normal level of optimization, linking to maxstack.o for example gcc maxstack.o -O3 myprogram.c -o myprogam
	4. Execute myprogram
	5. Program runs, at end prints out maximum stack usage

	Caveat Code!
